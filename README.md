Visualizing Singapore's Sea Level Rise with Google Earth Engine
This interactive project explores the potential consequences of sea level rise on Singapore. It leverages the power of Google Earth Engine (GEE) to analyze elevation data and generate a dynamic map.

Key Features:

SRTM Dataset Selection: Choose from various Digital Elevation Model (DEM) datasets to represent Singapore's topography.
Elevation Threshold: Define a critical elevation level to visualize areas vulnerable to flooding due to rising sea levels.
Interactive Land Area Opacity: Adjust the transparency of the landmass to enhance visualization clarity.
Real-time Land Loss Calculations: Observe the calculated area and percentage of land loss based on your chosen threshold.
